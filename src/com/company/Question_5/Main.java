        1. In the empty block comment below explain in your own words what making this class abstract does and why
        we would want to do that.

        /* ANSWER QUESTION HERE:

        By making the main class abstract we allow other classes that extend the main class to have access or run the Main class main method.
        If we want to start the program in another package we could have a class extend the main class to run the main method.
